# Reviews page

I am doing these exercises in order to solidify my vanilla JS knowledge.
This exercise is a simple Reviews Page containing basic elements, iterating through a dummy data array and displaying those values.
To try it out, download the files to your local machine and drag and drop the _index.html_ file into the browser.
Enjoy!
